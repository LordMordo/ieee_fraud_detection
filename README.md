General information
In this kernel I work with IEEE Fraud Detection competition.

EEE-CIS works across a variety of AI and machine learning areas, including deep neural networks, fuzzy systems, evolutionary computation, and swarm intelligence. Today they’re partnering with the world’s leading payment service company, Vesta Corporation, seeking the best solutions for fraud prevention industry, and now you are invited to join the challenge.

We have a binary classification problem with a heavy imbalance which is an inherent property of such problems. At first I'll explore the data and try to find valuable insights, maybe I'll do some feature engineering and then it wil be time to build models.
